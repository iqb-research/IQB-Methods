GitHub Copilot is an *AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code*. It is possible to integrate GitHub Copilot into R-Studio to speed up annoying coding tasks and get suggestions for code snippets. 

## Setup

To make the Copilot available in RStudio, you either need to have a [subscription to GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot), or (recommended) a [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education) account. It is free for students and faculty members. To get GitHub Education, you might need to upload a certificate showing that you are either a student, or affiliated with an university. For IQB-Members, it might be enough to upload a confirmation of your employment as researcher at the IQB, which you could request at IQB-Personal.  
After obtaining some sort of confirmation, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html) to connect GitHub Copilot with RStudio. 


## Usage
After installation, Copilot will make code suggestions, which you can accept by pressing `Tab`. `Enter/Return` will ignore the suggestion. If you want to give Copilot some additional instructions, you can just write them into a comment over the line you want the code suggestions in:

Generally, the suggestions work best for smaller, compartimentalized problems.
