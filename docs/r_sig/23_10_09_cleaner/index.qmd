## Some general take-aways

1.  Markdown vs. Quarto vs. R-Skripte

-   Quarto is more up to date than R-Markdown
-   Markdown has more dependencies, so I would now use .R-Scripts instead, if I don't need the markdown features.
-   In the end it's a question of preference.

1.  Write packages on top of the script.

-   Write down verion number (use `sessionInfo()`).
-   Or, even better: use `renv`.
