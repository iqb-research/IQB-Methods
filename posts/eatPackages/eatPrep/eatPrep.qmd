### Description

Preparation of test item data for IRT scaling using metadata provided by a predefined list structure as well as several tools and checks. Raw data can be read in and will be subjected to plausibility checks. Multiple datasets can be merged in a single step, incorporating detailed diagnostics for non-identical values among identical cases and variables. Data will be recoded according to the provided meta data, aggregated and scored. Handling different types of missing data is customizable according to user specifications. Further, missing patterns can be checked, various rater agreement measures and category discriminations can be calculated. The input metadata can be generated by the IQB-internal tool "AnalyseInput", which extracts item and test design information from the IQB database and formats it into a standardized xlsx file. This file can then be read by functions specifically designed for this task. Alternatively, the metadata can be provided in R-specific data formats.
