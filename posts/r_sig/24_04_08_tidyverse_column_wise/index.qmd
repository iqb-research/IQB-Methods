```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source(here::here("output_hook.R"))
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

athletes <- readRDS(file = here::here(  "raw_data", "athletes.rds"))

```

## Column-wise operations with `across()`

Instead of looping over columns with a [for-loop](https://iqb-research.github.io/IQB-Methods/posts/r_sig/23_03_20_forloops/), we can also use `across()` in combination with other `tidyverse` functions.

::: {.callout-note}
## `mutate_...()`
The functions `mutate_all()`, `mutate_at()`, and `mutate_if()` do the same, but are superseded. This means they still work, but the `tidyverse` team recommends to use `across()` instead. 
:::

Across can take column names and a function that should be applied to the selected columns:

```{r}
## Here we transform the Height and Weight columns to the type character:
athletes %>%
  mutate(across(c(Height, Weight), as.character)) %>%
  str
```

But it is also possible to select columns based on a selection function:

```{r}
## And here we transform all numeric columns into character:
athletes %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), as.character)) %>%
  str()
```

We can also specify our own transformation function.


## Using tidyverse functions in loops
When using tidyverse syntax within a loop, we might run into the problem that the tidyverse function can't deal with our iteration counter like we are used to:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Trying to transform the Height and Weight column to character using a for-loop.
## Note: Normally across() would be a better option in this case (and most of the time anyways).
##       But sometimes a good old fashioned for-loop might be easier to programm to get the job done, 
##       in which case one should keep some specifics in mind: 

## This throws an error: 
athletes_2 <- athletes

for(i in c("Height", "Weight")){
  athletes_2 <- athletes_2 %>%
    mutate(i = as.character(.$i))
}


```

This doesn't work, because we are trying to program a function using [data masking](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html#data-masking). Data masking just means that we don't have to type `athletes$Height` in a `tidyverse` function, but simply `Height`, because the function knows this refers to a column in the current data.frame.  

### Loops
- In the case of `mutate()`, we have to use **dynamic dots**, which need to used if we want to create names programmatically: `:=` instead of `=`. 
- We need to **embrace** the changeable variable (either in a function or a loop) like this: `{{var}}`.
- In `mutate()`, we can also simply write `"{var}_..."` to paste together a new column name. 
- If we just want to extract data, we can use the `.data` pronoun (or the `.` as short version) with `[[` ([see here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html#indirection)).

```{r}
athletes_2 <- athletes

for(i in c("Height", "Weight")){
  athletes_2 <- athletes_2 %>%
    mutate({{i}} := as.character(.[[i]]))
}
str(athletes_2)

for(i in c("Height", "Weight")){
  athletes_2 <- athletes_2 %>%
    mutate({{i}} := as.character({{i}}))
}
str(athletes_2)

## With programmatically built new columns: 
athletes_3 <- athletes
for(i in c("Height", "Weight")){
  athletes_3 <- athletes_3 %>%
    mutate("{i}_char" := as.character(.[[i]]))
}

str(athletes_3)
```

### Functions
This also applies if we want to define a function with column names as arguments, using `tidyverse` inside. Here we need to embrace our variable as well to make it data masking friendly: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
## This doesn't work:
print_col <- function(dat, var){
  print(dat %>% pull(var))
}

athletes %>%
  print_col(Region)

```

```{r output.lines = 4}
## This works:
print_col <- function(dat, var){
  print(dat %>% pull({{var}}))
}

athletes %>%
  print_col(Region)

```


::: {.callout-note}
## !!sym()
In previous SIG-Sessions we have used `!!sym()` for this, which also works, but is more to remember:

```{r}
athletes_2 <- athletes
for(i in c("Height", "Weight")){
  athletes_2 <- athletes_2 %>%
    mutate(!!sym(i) := as.character(!!sym(i)))
}

str(athletes_2)
```

# Exercise

0. Read the `characters.rds` and the `psych_stats.csv` into R (download [here](https://github.com/iqb-research/IQB-Methods/tree/main/raw_data)).

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{r}
characters <- readRDS(here::here(  "raw_data", "characters.rds"))
psych_stats <- read.csv(here::here(  "raw_data", "psych_stats.csv"), sep = ";")
```
:::

1. Write a function that can standardize a numeric column. It should take a `data.frame` and a column as arguments. 
To standardize, the function should subtract the mean of the column from each of its raw values and then divide each difference by the standard deviation of the original variable.   
Finally, it should return a numeric vector containing the standardized values. 
Make the function work with data masking!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
To extract a single column as a vector to do some operations on it you can use `pull()`.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{r}
standardize_var <- function(dat, var){
  column <- dat %>%
    pull({{var}}) 
  
if(!is.numeric(column)){stop(paste0("Please provide a numeric column! Yours has the type '", typeof(column), "'."))}

  column_std <- (column - mean(column)) / sd(column)
  return(column_std)
}

## test the function:
# standardize_var(athletes, Region)

standardized_col <- psych_stats %>% 
  standardize_var(messy_neat)

mean(standardized_col) %>% round(5)
sd(standardized_col)

```

:::

2. Apply this function within a for-loop on 10 columns of your choice. Add the standardized columns as new columns to your data frame. 

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{r}
for(i in colnames(psych_stats)[20:29]){
 psych_stats <- psych_stats %>%
    mutate("{i}_std" := standardize_var(psych_stats, .data[[i]]))
}

mean(psych_stats$flexible_rigid_std)
sd(psych_stats$flexible_rigid_std)

```
:::


3. Now build the same standardization function, but it should only take a numeric vector as input, not a whole `data.frame`. 

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{r}
standardize_var_2 <- function(vec){
  if(!is.numeric(vec)){stop(paste0("Please provide a numeric vector! Yours has the type '", typeof(vec), "'."))}
  (vec- mean(vec))/sd(vec)
}

## Testing the function
standardize_var_2(c(1,2,3))
# standardize_var_2(c("a",2,3))

```
:::

4. Apply one of your two standardization functions onto the psych_stats `data.frame` using `across()`. The standardized columns should be added to the data frame. Think carefully about which one should be used in this context and why.  
This exercise is a little bit harder, so use google, StackOverflow and the help function `?` within R. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
- Look at the documentation of `across()` to see how you can give new column names into `mutate()` from within `across()`.
- It's probably easier to use a function that only takes a vector, and not the whole data.frame within `across()`.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

## Solution

```{r}
psych_stats_std <- psych_stats %>%
  mutate(
    across(
    .cols = where(is.numeric), 
    .fns = standardize_var_2, 
    .names = "{.col}_standardized"
    )
  )

mean(psych_stats_std$innocent_jaded_standardized)
```

I used the function that only takes a vector: using it within `across()` made it possible to just provide the function, and not having to deal with the extra data argument. The only argument in my function is the vector, and it is more naturally for across to handle, because it already applies a function to a column, so the extraction is not necessary.
