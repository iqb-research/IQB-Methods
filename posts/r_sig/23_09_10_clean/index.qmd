## Some general take-aways

1. Markdown vs. Quarto vs. R-Skripte
  - Quarto is more up to date than R-Markdown
  - Markdown has more dependencies, so I would now use .R-Scripts instead, if I don't need the markdown features.
  - In the end it's a question of preference.
1. Write packages on top of the script. 
  - Write down verion number (use `sessionInfo()`). 
  - Or, even better: use `renv`.
