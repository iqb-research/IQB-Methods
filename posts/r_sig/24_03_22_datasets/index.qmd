We will use two data sets for some time in the R SIG now. One for the theory, and one for you to work on in the exercises.

## Theory: Olympic athletes

For the theory part of the workshop, we will mainly work with the [`athletes`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) data set. It contains the Olympic athletes from 1896 to 2016, along with some basic stats, their sport and country, and the medals they won.

## Goal

Our goal for the theory part of this workshop is to find the best country in each sport (operationalized by the number of gold medal winners from this country).

## Exercises: Fictional characters

Over the course of this workshop, you can work on exercises to put the theoretical knowledge you acquired in the chapters to use. Most of these exercises will use the [`characters`](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/documentation/) data set, which contains psychometric ratings for different fictional characters, rated by a large number of people on a personality scale developed by the author of the questionnaire.

You will load the data, prepare it for analyses and also plot it in the end.

## Goal

The goal for the exercise part of this workshop is to build a character profile for a fictional universe of your choosing.
